###Touch based switch board using Aluminium foil
----------

A simple application of capsense is to create touch based switch boards. The concept is really simple, we keep tracking the time it takes to fully charge the thus formed capacitor (metal ~ Aluminium Foil in this case).

We set a threshold value `100` in this case and set is as the case when we have changed the capacitance by touching the metal with our hands or some other object which can couple with it.
